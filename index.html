                    Within my studies I have gained insightful advantages in how software companies develop,
                    focusing on developing a business case document regarding cloud migration,
                    alongside group experience of SCRUM development environments.
                    My verbal communication skills are key to the fact that I have led every group project within both
                    years of my study, alongside an attentiveness in detail and time management.</p>
